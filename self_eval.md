# Self-Evaluation

- **Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?**
We had a pretty long OOP session where we went back and forth a lot and I think got into some pretty unproductive struggle. After the session I went through the Methods assignment and learned the way we were supposed to execute the dino `roar` method and it made so much more sense. I had been trying to use an instance method there but we weren't changing anything and got really hung up there. I'm really proud of myself in that I was able to pull the new method information over to our OOP project and get a clearer understanding of the Driver/navigator practice problem

- **What is the power of using methods in our applications?**
The biggest thing with methods that makes them so handy and powerful in application is that once they are defined, they can be used over and over again, as many times as you need to. Ruby also has tons of built in methods that you can call on your various variables and arrays to help you manipulate your variables.
